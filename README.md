The Game Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is the first "major" thing I have built in JavaScript.

Using the Math.random method I cycled through the list of options for the computer choice.
Then prompt for getting the player choice.
The playRound section took me the longest to figure out (I tried 'switch' method, till i relized it was used for one value not two).
Once I got the game round done all I had to do was loop through it five times.
Each loop through (using the returned value) use a if statement to see who gets the point
At the end print the winner based opon the score. (Like the casino's, the house wins so ties go to the computer).
